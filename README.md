# EverSol-Custom-Typescript

EverSol, as a milestone, is set to release here on GitHub, its own custom Python script needed to automate the process of reward distribution, for free. This move aims to promote equal opportunities and stimulate growth in the Solana ecosystem. By incentivizing developers to create reward tokens, EverSol anticipates sparking new projects and ideas, thereby attracting more participants to the Solana network.

This TypeScript script is designed to run on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) to automate the process of rewarding token holders and distributing those rewards accordingly. With seamless integration, it efficiently manages the allocation of rewards and ensures timely distribution to holders proportionally.
